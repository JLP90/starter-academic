Currently, I coordinate two courses at Erasmus University Rotterdam:
- "People at Work" - a first-year introductory organizational psychology course
- "Attitudes and Emotions in Organizations" - a graduate course in the Work and Organizational Psychology Master

I am also coordinating a practical called "Conducting Research in Organizations" in the Work and Organizational Psychology Master. And I  supervise approximately 10-15 undergraduate and graduate students each year.
