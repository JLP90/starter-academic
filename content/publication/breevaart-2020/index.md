abstract: "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the weekly effects of\
  \ job insecurity on employee voice and silence. Specifically, the authors argue\
  \ that because employment fulfils important needs, employees' needs are less fulfilled\
  \ when they feel that their job is at risk (i.e. high job insecurity). Consequently,\
  \ the authors argue that employees engage in less voice and more silence because\
  \ when employees' needs are not fulfilled, they are less committed to the organization\
  \ and/or protect their personal resources. Design/methodology/approach: The authors\
  \ tested their hypotheses in a five-week long diary study among 97 employees. Findings:\
  \ The authors found that employees reported lower need fulfilment in those weeks\
  \ and the week after job insecurity was higher, which, in turn, decreased employee\
  \ voice and increased employee silence in those weeks and the week after. Research\
  \ limitations/implications: The study shows that feelings about one's job insecurity\
  \ fluctuate from week to week and that the weekly negative effects associated with\
  \ increased job insecurity can be explained from a needs fulfilment perspective.\
  \ The study also highlights the importance of studying voice and silence simultaneously.\
  \ Practical implications: Managers could indirectly increase employees' voice and\
  \ decrease employees' silence by reducing feelings of job insecurity to increase\
  \ employees' feelings of predictability of and control over their future. Originality/value:\
  \ The authors studied short-term effects of job insecurity on both employee voice\
  \ and silence, and examined need fulfilment as an underlying mechanism to explain\
  \ the effects of job insecurity."
