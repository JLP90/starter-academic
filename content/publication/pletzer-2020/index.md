abstract: Personality research suggests that the prediction of organizational behavior
  can be improved by examining the criterion-related validity of narrow personality
  facets. In the current study, we provide meta-analytic effect size estimates (k
  = 29) for the relations of all HEXACO domains and facets with workplace deviance
  and re-analyze available data (k = 9) to compare the criterion-related validity
  of the HEXACO domains with that of their constituent facets. Findings provided evidence
  for a masking effect among the facets of Honesty-Humility and a cancellation effect
  among the facets of Openness to Experience. Furthermore, facets generally outperformed
  domains in predicting workplace deviance. This was most notable for the Fairness
  facet, which explained almost as much variance in workplace deviance as all six
  HEXACO domains combined. These results suggest that using a few HEXACO facets to
  predict workplace deviance can be more efficient than using all six broad domains.
